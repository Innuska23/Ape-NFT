## Description:

The APE NFT application consists of 8 sections:

## Header:

Contains the logo, burger menu on all versions.
The logo is a link to the page.
Contains a close button, navigation menu, and social media links.
Each menu item should be clickable, and when clicked, the mobile menu should close smoothly, and the page should scroll smoothly to the corresponding section.
The height of the burger menu on mobile devices spans the entire screen and has a black background.
On tablets, the burger menu is transparent, losing its background, and looks similar to the desktop version.

## Hero:

When clicking on "Meet Apes," there is a smooth scroll to the Mint section.

## About:

The section includes a title, two text blocks, an image, and a banner.
(As an additional task) The banner (red line with text) should have a "moving line" animation.

## MIND map:

When styling cards for tablets and desktops, use CSS Grid.

In the mobile version, the cards are placed in a slider. The slider can be navigated by dragging or using buttons, and it has standard behavior (non-infinite). Clicking or dragging scrolls one slide.

The red card should be active and contain a link (any link).

## FAQ:

By default, the first answer is open.

On mobile, only the title and text are displayed initially. Starting from the tablet version, opening different items should also change the image.

Only one answer can be open at a time.

When an item is opened, the color of the question and numbers changes, and a background (along with an image on all screens except mobile) appears.

## Arts:

The section contains a slider on all versions. On mobile, there is only one slide, on tablets - two, and on desktops - four. The slider can be navigated both by dragging and using buttons, and it has standard behavior (not infinite). Clicking or dragging flips one slide at a time.
